You'll need to be logged in with your UCD email to access it
and will have to download the video to view it.
This folder contains our Info Session video and 
will have all future Code Jam and Workshop video presentations as well.

## This Quarter

This quarter we plan to do something different from previous years.
We are doing longer projects that takes the whole quarter
instead of weekly or biweekly as before.
The project is group based and highly collaborative and a little more development-intensive.
The officers group will lead the project and gives talks and workshops
during the quarter to guide you on the progress.

Also, feel free to send PR and issues to any repo in the club!
